# Components

Folder for components of this website that are reusable (used in 2 or more part) or need to be separated to prevent reading fatigue

## File Naming

I use camelCase to specify these files are components. Examples:

- `activeNotesBody.jsx`
- `deleteNotesButton.jsx`

Some files that excluded are:

- This file (`README.md`)
- `footer.jsx`
- `header.jsx`

## Function/Class Naming

I use PascalCase to specify the file's function name/class
